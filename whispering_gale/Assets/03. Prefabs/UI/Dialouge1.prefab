    sentences:
    - ' When do children become adults? I''m sure I''m not the only person who has
      asked herself this question.'
    - ' Nothing has changed from yesterday, but starting from today I''m 20. So I''m
      free to go wherever I want, buy alcohol, blahblahblah.'
    - ' Or so the laws say - I mean, it doesn''t say that I have the guts to do anything
      that... brave... will the word reckless be more suitable?'
    - " It\u2019s been a very boring birthday so far; the dinner was about my grades
      and future."
    - " I think the old topic of politics would be much better-\nmy attention drifts
      away without any effort, whereas if I\u2019m the topic, my ears perk up just
      to feed my brain displeasure."
    - " Don\u2019t get me wrong - I love my parents and am thankful for their attention.
      It\u2019s the fact that I can\u2019t give any retorts that make me unreasonably
      angry.\r"
    - " Grandpa would say something like, \"Where has the \u201Ctwenties\u2019 passion
      gone in this century?\""
    - ' But he''s gone, and everyone  I know is following the same, seemingly ages-old
      but actually recently-paved-and-will-shift-according-to-paradigm path.'
    - " I don\u2019t know if this is right, but the word \"right\" itself is ambiguous
      to the point of meaninglessness."
    - " So I\u2019m just lost in thought. Sorry if I bored you - and me."
    - ' ...'
    - " Hmm\u2026 but it is my birthday\u2026 so I\u2019m going to do something naughty."
