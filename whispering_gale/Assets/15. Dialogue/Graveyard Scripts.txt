Dialogue2_MeetMegan
0 Louis) Hello...
1 Megan) Oh, hi. Are you visiting a relative? I'm Megan, the part-time keeper of this graveyard, so ask me if you need anything.
2 Louis) Um, I was wondering if my grandfather - he's over there - left anything in the hands of the previous gatekeeper, Tom.
3 Megan) Are you Louis, his granddaughter?
4 Louis) Yes - do I need to show my ID card?
5 Megan) Nah. I'll just relay what Tom always talked about. If you're not his kid then I don't think you'll get it anyway.
6 Megan) Your grandfather left behind a request - and a ton of money - to tell you about the three time capsules you, him, and your grandmother buried when you were ten.
7 Megan) The first one is... "inside Tom's wish."
8 Megan) And Tom's wish was for the wind to whisper words of comfort to the mourning.
9 Megan) What do you make of that? Personally, I think Tom was trying to get his hands on more money from your grandfather...
10 Louis) (The compass isn't pointing towards her, and the light has vanished...)
11 Louis) I'll... try to investigate. Grandpa always liked riddles.
12 Megan) Well, good luck then.
