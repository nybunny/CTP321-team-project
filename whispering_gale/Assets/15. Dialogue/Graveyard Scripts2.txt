Dialogue3_MisterDragon
0 Louis) Are those two animals... Mythicals?
1 Louis) I remember seeing them from afar, but since they don't exist in the Upper City, wow...
2 Louis) Excuse me, may I ask a question?
3 Rabbit) Can't you see I'm dancin'?
4 Louis) U-Um...
5 Mouse) Hey, hey, Rabbit. Calm down. Anyone can ask a question. What would you like answered?
6 Louis) I was wondering if you knew anything about Tom's wish?
7 Mouse) Hmm... To-mmy... Wasn't his wish to meet the dead?
8 Rabbit) No, Mr.Mouse. The Keeper didn't dream for the dead; he dreamt for the living.
9 Mouse) Hey, why'd you identify meeting the dead with death?
10 Rabbit) Well, what other way is there?
11 Mouse) Mister Dragon used to be around...
12 Rabbit) But Mister Dragon's DEAD here, you Mouse. He went back to the p--
13 Louis) I'm sorry to interrupt your banter, Ms--
14 Rabbit) Call me Rabbit. I'll call you Human in return.
15 Louis) ...Is Rabbit your name?
16 Rabbit) It's what humans call untamed rabbits. If that's what you mean by "name," then yes.
17 Mouse) Excuse her antisocial tendencies. She abhors individuality in interracial conversations.
18 Mouse) Call me Mous-ey. Cuz I like a little specialt-y.
19 Mousey) And let me call you Louis-ey. Or will plain Louis fit your taste?
20 Louis) (How did he know my name? I thought brain-reading magic was too complex to perform during conversation.)
21 Rabbit) No, this male mouse is getting his hopes up in life.
22 Rabbit) What am I to claim superiority over the white fluffy kids running around here?
23 Rabbit) What are you, Mr.Mouse, to identify yourself with what you have been given by luck of ti--
24 Louis) (This conversation is getting out of hand...)
25 Louis) Ms.Rabbit, who was Mister Dragon?
26 Rabbit) It, not who.
27 Rabbit) It was one of us, though couple steps closer to magic's - and our - essence than me or Mr.Mouse.
28 Rabbit) It could speak to the dead, and was almost worshipped by the people.
29 Louis) ...really?
30 Rabbit) ...You're speaking to us.
31 Louis) ???
32 Rabbit) (sigh) Go up the hill and reach the top - that tower. You'll be able to see what Mister Dragon looked like.
33 Mousey) Yes, do so, Louisey.
34 Mousey) It will do you good. More good than watching our dance research and nonsense rap battles, at least.
35 Mousey) Go, go. And send Mister Dragon's remains our reminiscences.
36 Louis) Okay... Thank you.

--> next action: Mousey's dance changes

Dialogue4_JohnsTale (triggred by Dialogue4_Trigger.cs, attached to Dragon)
0 John) Ya here to see the dragon, or the tower?
1 Louis) I... heard that people used to believe this dragon could talk to the dead, so I came to see why.
2 John) Why, eh? Well that's a tough question.
3 Louis) Do you know anything about it?
4 John) Know a bit.
5 John) When I was a young one, it was a sort of common knowledge that Mister Dragon could reach the dead, and send them our messages. 
6 John) You see, this statue moved when it saw grief - or at least my mom and dad said so.
7 John) So people hiked all the way up here to look over the graveyard and send their words to the people down there.
8 John) But as time passed and magic was researched people stopped believing in stupid myths. 
9 John) Nobody comes here anymore unless they want exercise, or they're old like me and miss all the laughing and crying.
10 John) Oh, and I remember the dragon being a lot bigger- as big as that tower - but then I was small...
11 Louis) (If the dragon was as big as the tower, it should have been a lot thicker...)
12 Louis) Then how was that tower built?
13 John) Oh, that tower's not that old. It was built like 10 years ago - by a couple older than me.
14 John) Weird folks; well-educated but believing in the dragon. Maybe they liked the idea of people believing in it?
15 John) Well anyway, there was a couple from the outside that tried to make the dragon as big as I thought it used to be.
16 John) They failed - I dunno why, when they looked like a pair of strong magicians. Maybe the dragon didn't like them?
17 John) So they built the tower instead, and magicked it to send a breeze whenever people cried in the graveyard.
18 John) Tom - the graveyard keeper - liked it. He said winds whisper comfort. But then all he ever said was poetry.
19 Louis) Did the tower's spell bring people back here?
20 John) Somewhat. But it brung back the people who'd forgotten about the dragon, not the ones who'd never even heard of Mister Dragon. So it wasn't much.
21 John) Besides, the spell's gone. It died out with the couple.
22 John) Tom tried to re-cast it, but he's never studied magic harder than cleaning the kitchen, and now he's too sick to walk up here by himself.
23 John) And that's it. 
24 John) If Mister Dragon really is getting smaller, will he disappear when Tom and I and our friends are all dead?

--> next action: John walks away
--> next action: Dialogue5
(& after quest11 is complete, change John's motion from john@Sad Idle -> john@Idle)

Dialogue5_CastSpell
0 Louis) (Making winds in response to crying - or sadness... it's advanced magic, but it's also something Grandma taught me.)
1 Louis) (I think I can cast this spell...)
2 Louis) .........
3 Louis) Done!

--> next action: tower lights up momentarily
--> next action: Orb appears

Dialogue6 is triggered when Louis interacts with the Orb, which turns into a piece of paper

Dialogue6_LetterFromGrandpa
0 Louis) Inside the orb was an old paper with a memo attached to it.
The memo turned out to be a letter from Grandpa.
1 Louis) The memo read:
2 Grandpa) This old paper is a bucket list that I wrote when I was twenty-one, and stuck inside a book 
3 Grandpa) I wanted to read. Finding and re-reading it last week while picking books to give away made me feel despondent.
4 Grandpa) It was a list of things I wanted to do after retirement - the portrait of a young man dreaming of old age, of the end of life!
5 Grandpa) I decided to put this in my time capsule because I do not want my dear Louis to follow this path. 
6 Grandpa) Putting off the things that I really wanted to do made my time more or less a burden.
7 Grandpa) Besides, you should know I haven't accomplished half of the things written here. 
8 Grandpa) (For starters, I was about to give that book away without reading it!)
9 Grandpa) If you're reading this letter then you must be wondering what to do with your life, at least a bit.
10 Grandpa) This is an old know-it-all's wish; please dream of middle-age before retirement, and of youth before middle-age. 
11 Grandpa) Look at the trail at least for a moment before letting your eyes reach the peak.
12 Grandpa) I did not know how to value time as much as your Grandma did, and I lost the chance to make more memories. This is proof of my regret.
13 Grandpa) Well, then on to the next time capsule, my lady!
Love, Grandpa
14 Louis) I couldn't help but give the letter a teary smile, mixed with a drop of resentment.
15 Louis) Like always, he had left me with questions, not answers.
16 Louis) I sighed, and returned to the house for the day.
